http://pixijs.io/examples/#/filters/blur-filter.js Example} of the\n * {@link PIXI.filters.BlurFilter BlurFilter}.\n *\n * ### Usage\n * Filters can be applied to any DisplayObject or Container.\n * PixiJS' `FilterSystem` renders the container into temporary Framebuffer,\n * then filter renders it to the screen.\n * Multiple filters can be added to the `filters` array property and stacked on each other.\n *\n * ```\n * const filter = new PIXI.Filter(myShaderVert, myShaderFrag, { myUniform: 0.5 });\n * const container = new PIXI.Container();\n * container.filters = [filter];\n * ```\n *\n * ### Previous Version Differences\n *\n * In PixiJS **v3**, a filter was always applied to _whole screen_.\n *\n * In PixiJS **v4**, a filter can be applied _only part of the screen_.\n * Developers had to create a set of uniforms to deal with coordinates.\n *\n * In PixiJS **v5** combines _both approaches_.\n * Developers can use normal coordinates of v3 and then allow filter to use partial Framebuffers,\n * bringing those extra uniforms into account.\n *\n * Also be aware that we have changed default vertex shader, please consult\n * {@link https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js/wiki/v5-Creating-filters Wiki}.\n *\n * ### Built-in Uniforms\n *\n * PixiJS viewport uses screen (CSS) coordinates, `(0, 0, renderer.screen.width, renderer.screen.height)`,\n * and `projectionMatrix` uniform maps it to the gl viewport.\n *\n * **uSampler**\n *\n * The most important uniform is the input texture that container was rendered into.\n * _Important note: as with all Framebuffers in PixiJS, both input and output are\n * premultiplied by alpha._\n *\n * By default, input normalized coordinates are passed to fragment shader with `vTextureCoord`.\n * Use it to sample the input.\n *\n * ```\n * const fragment = `\n * varying vec2 vTextureCoord;\n * uniform sampler2D uSampler;\n * void main(void)\n * {\n *    gl_FragColor = texture2D(uSampler, vTextureCoord);\n * }\n * `;\n *\n * const myFilter = new PIXI.Filter(null, fragment);\n * ```\n *\n * This filter is just one uniform less than {@link PIXI.filters.AlphaFilter AlphaFilter}.\n *\n * **outputFrame**\n *\n * The `outputFrame` holds the rectangle where filter is applied in screen (CSS) coordinates.\n * It's the same as `renderer.screen` for a fullscreen filter.\n * Only a part of  `outputFrame.zw` size of temporary Framebuffer is used,\n * `(0, 0, outputFrame.width, outputFrame.height)`,\n *\n * Filters uses this quad to normalized (0-1) space, its passed into `aVertexPosition` attribute.\n * To calculate vertex position in screen space using normalized (0-1) space:\n *\n * ```\n * vec4 filterVertexPosition( void )\n * {\n *     vec2 position = aVertexPosition * max(outputFrame.zw, vec2(0.)) + outputFrame.xy;\n *     return vec4((projectionMatrix * vec3(position, 1.0)).xy, 0.0, 1.0);\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * **inputSize**\n *\n * Temporary framebuffer is different, it can be either the size of screen, either power-of-two.\n * The `inputSize.xy` are size of temporary framebuffer that holds input.\n * The `inputSize.zw` is inverted, it's a shortcut to evade division inside the shader.\n *\n * Set `inputSize.xy = outputFrame.zw` for a fullscreen filter.\n *\n * To calculate input normalized coordinate, you have to map it to filter normalized space.\n * Multiply by `outputFrame.zw` to get input coordinate.\n * Divide by `inputSize.xy` to get input normalized coordinate.\n *\n * ```\n * vec2 filterTextureCoord( void )\n * {\n *     return aVertexPosition * (outputFrame.zw * inputSize.zw); // same as /inputSize.xy\n * }\n * ```\n * **resolution**\n *\n * The `resolution` is the ratio of screen (CSS) pixels to real pixels.\n *\n * **inputPixel**\n *\n * `inputPixel.xy` is the size of framebuffer in real pixels, same as `inputSize.xy * resolution`\n * `inputPixel.zw` is inverted `inputPixel.xy`.\n *\n * It's handy for filters that use neighbour pixels, like {@link PIXI.filters.FXAAFilter FXAAFilter}.\n *\n * **inputClamp**\n *\n * If you try to get info from outside of used part of Framebuffer - you'll get undefined behaviour.\n * For displacements, coordinates has to be clamped.\n *\n * The `inputClamp.xy` is left-top pixel center, you may ignore it, because we use left-top part of Framebuffer\n * `inputClamp.zw` is bottom-right pixel center.\n *\n * ```\n * vec4 color = texture2D(uSampler, clamp(modifigedTextureCoord, inputClamp.xy, inputClamp.zw))\n * ```\n * OR\n * ```\n * vec4 color = texture2D(uSampler, min(modifigedTextureCoord, inputClamp.zw))\n * ```\n *\n * ### Additional Information\n *\n * Complete documentation on Filter usage is located in the\n * {@link https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js/wiki/v5-Creating-filters Wiki}.\n *\n * Since PixiJS only had a handful of built-in filters, additional filters can be downloaded\n * {@link

This gives us a very fast way of looking up a progress position rather than looping through all the points/Beziers.
